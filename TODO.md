# Sabbatical To Do
* macros
* stdlib
* re-add repl

# Post Sabbatical (at some point)
* event-loop base.
* ffi
* structs


* introduce sets into disp.
* functions can be created that operate on specific interfaces in specific ways, but can be overriden (polymorphism)
* if / else is a little hacky in that the else block is omitted if it doesn't exist,
  which can produce erroneous values. That should be fixed.
