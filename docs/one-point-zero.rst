Disp's Road to 1.0
==================

Disp is currently highly experimental, and many attributes about it may change. Disp has a specific set of goals it is targetting before reaching 1.0, enumerated here:

* a fully functioning macro system
* a well designed solution for the `Array-of-structs and Structs-of-arrays problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOS_and_SOA>`_
* performance within 1-2x of C for almost all use cases, including high-throughput applications
* a module system
* working solutions to all disp-cases
