Contributing
============

If you're interested in joining the development of Disp, fantastic! We are in the process of building a community.

The easiest way to contribute is to add your thoughts to the `RFCs <https://github.com/toumorokoshi/disp/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Arfc>`_: there are a lot of ideas that need further fleshing out, and if you have good evidence or use cases, please leave a comment.


Contributing Code
*****************

Contributing code can be done by forking and sending pull requests via `Github <https://github.com/toumorokoshi/disp>`_. If you are looking for something to work on, please see `the open issues <https://github.com/toumorokoshi/disp/issues>`_

Please note that the code is still in a large amount of flux, as implementation details are fleshed out. Any suggestions or improvements are welcome.
